# Airbnb Project Hyperparameter Tuning with Python


# 1. Defining the Question
# Class project week 7
a) Specifying the Data Analysis Question
As a Data Scientist working for Airbnb, you have been tasked to create a model that predicts Airbnb rental prices for the city of Amsterdam. Popularity for Airbnbs in Amsterdam has grown over the past years and you are required to build a solution the would make optimal predictions.

b) Defining the Metric for Success
The metrics we will use to evaluate our model are RMSE and R2 scores.

c) Understanding the Context
Airbnb is an American vacation rental online marketplace company based in San Francisco, California, United States. Airbnb offers arrangement for lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking.

# Recommendations / Conclusion
e) Data Relevance
The data provided was relevant to answering the research question.




# 5. Summary of Findings

- Summarize your findings.

Our best model is Decision Tree & RandomForest that have been optimized using Random Search with an RMSE of 50.25
# 6. Recommendations

- Airbnb should use Decision Tree & RandomForest predictions to predict rental prices

# 7. Challenging your Solution

a) Did we have the right question?
 - YES

b) Did we have the right data?
- The data was relevant for the question asked

c) What can be done to improve the solution?
- We can perform more hyperparameter tuning on the models to improve the performance.

Additionally , we can try out other regression analysis models.
